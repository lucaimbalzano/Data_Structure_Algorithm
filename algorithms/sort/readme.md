# Sort Algorithms - Classification

They are used for the 30% in the avg applications 

Sort
```asm
    - Intern: it works in RAM
    - External: it works in Sys Storage or Hybrid
    - Stable: Elements not change at the end of the execution
    - Instable: Elements change at the end of the execution
    - Adaptive: Is based on how the inpute elements are ordered
    - Not Adaptive: : indifferent for how the input elements are ordered
    - Online: we can execute the algorithm and get the input elements in progressive way, as he finish  
    - Offline: before to execute the algorithm he needs all the input elments
    - Iterative: only loop
    - Recursive: 
    - Computational Complexity:
        - O(n)
        - O(n Log n)
        - O(nÂ²)
